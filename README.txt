There are two parts to our submission.  The first is our ReLogo project with all of our source code.  The second is a .jar that will install a working standalone version of our project to your computer.  A copy of our proposal has also been included for further clarification if needed.

Opening project/source code in IDE
1 - Extract the submitted zipped file to a folder on your computer.
2 - Open ReLogo Eclipse using any workspace of your choice
3 - File -> Import, under "General" select "Existing Projects into Workspace" then press "Next"
4 - Select "Browse..." next to the root directory option and select the folder where you extracted the code to
5 - Press Finish.  The entirety of the "Rats" source code should be displayed in its hierarchy and accessible through the package explorer
6 - To run, first click the dropdown next to the run icon in the toolbar at the top.  Click "Organize Favorites", "Add...", then add the "Rats Model" option.
7 - You can now run the program out of the IDE by clicking the dropdown next to the run icon and choosing the "Rats Model" option.

Installing and Running the Standalone Program
1 - Run the unzipped "rats_setup.jar" file
2 - Proceed through installer, accepting the agreement and selecting where you would like to install the program to.  
3 - After installation is complete, navigate to the designated folder and run the "start_model.bat" file.  This may take a few moments, but will open the "Rats" program in a standalone Repast Simphony instance.


Our program also generates various statistics, available in the root folder as 2 CSV files.
